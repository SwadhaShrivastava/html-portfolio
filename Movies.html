    <h1>My movies list</h1>
    <h2>I am really fond of watching movies be it any genre.....Here are the top 3 that are my any favourites</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Bang Bang</h3>
    <p>This movie is a package of action, romance, suspense, and comedy which makes it my first choice<p>
    <h3>Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham</h3>
    <p>How beautifully this movie has portrayed family life and the love and challenges that a family faces is really incredible. Also the acting of all the fabulous stars has made it such an emotional film to watch</p>
    <h3>War</h3>
    <p>Again coming to action and love for your nation.....this movie has made place in my heart due to its suspense and confusing plot with secrets revealing in different timeline....as if playing past and present randomly in the movie</p>
